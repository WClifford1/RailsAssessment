# README
# Two sided marketplace:
# 
We have created an app which will be using Ruby on Rails which is connected to a Postgresql database
#Authenication
We use the Ruby gem Devise which sets up the authentication for the application.
#Authorisation
The application will also be using Devise for the Authorisation features.
#Uploading capability of images
We will be using active storage for the time being as we are still trying work out cloudinary or similar services
